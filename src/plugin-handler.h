    Loads a plugin
    
    The function can be used to load an open orbit plugin. There exist a number
    of different plugins such as vessels, engines and instruments. The
    recommended layout of the plugin-directory is that it should contain the
    directories: vessels, instruments, actuators
    \param filename The name of the file that shall be loaded. Per default the
        following paths are searched in this order:
        ~/.openorbit/plugins/, $PREFIX/share/openorbit/plugins on a regular
        UNIX-like system. On the Mac OS X, the following paths are searched as
        well after the previous mentioned paths:
        "~/Library/Application Support/Open Orbit/Plugins",
        "/Library/Application Support/Open Orbit/Plugins" and
        "/Network/Library/Application Support/Open Orbit/Plugins".
        
        The filename shall be supplied without its extension, the extention will
        be determined from the platform and added automatically (this is .so on
        Linux and .dylib on MacOS X or .scm for Scheme plugins).
    \return A zero terminated c-string containing the identifier of the plugin.
