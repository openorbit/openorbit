 * This header and the scripting functions provide a script language
 * independent scripting interface (to some extent). The only currently
 * supported language is Python; the early development of Open Orbit used
 * Scheme (through Guile), so there are remains of this system around (and it
 * might be interesting to revive it in the future).
