#+TITLE: Copying Open Orbit

Some texture maps and 3d models come originally from NASA, but may have been
modified since retrieval. Guidelines for NASA images and models are available
at [[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/MP_Photo_Guidelines.html]]
and at [[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/imagepolicy/]]

Some texture maps come from the USGS astrogeology website, for more info see:

In general, attribution is given in a file in the same directory as the models.
