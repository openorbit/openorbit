Open Orbit is a free realistic and modular spacecraft simulator. The purpose is
to let the user experience orbital space flight in a realistic manner.

The package that this read me is part of is the source distribution, this
readme will give you pointers to where you find manuals, build instructions,
documentation and so forth. This document should be used as an entry point for
you, in order to help you get familiar with the open orbit source code, build
procedures, plugin development and so forth.


For build instructions see INSTALL.txt
For coding conventions see [[./HACKING.org]]
For the license see [[./COPYING.txt]]
For plugin development see PLUGINS.txt (not yet written)

The goal is to have the documentation written in Emacs org-mode syntax. This
enables us to firstly read the docs as is, and secondly to publish the docs
into HTML, PDF and other formats.
