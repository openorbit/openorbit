Math and Physics in Open Orbit
==============================

Open Orbit simulates the movement of solar system bodies and spacecraft within.
It does not handle extra solar system objects at present.

Coordinate Systems
-----------------
The primary global coordinate system is the ICRF system. This rougly matches
the equatorial system of the J2000.0 epoch.

In laymen terms, this means that:
  The x-axis points at the vernal equinox as it was at the year 2000.
  The y-axis is the right handed cross product of the x and z axises
  The z-axis points upwards toward the earths north pole

Since the core of the simulator is implemented using rigid body dynamics, all
coordinates are rectangular internally. However, conversion functions exists
in the celmek library.
