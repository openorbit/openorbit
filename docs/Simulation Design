Simulation Design
=================

Each spacecraft consist of separate stage-objects. Stages have actuators. Stages
also have actuator groups, which are connected to the I/O system. A couple of
groups exsits that are default and usually bound by the user's keymap.

Group#  Name
------  ----
0       orbital
1       vertical
2       horisontal
3       forward
4       pitch
5       roll
6       yaw
8       flaps
8-127   RESERVED

When you design your spacecraft you usually add an actuator to one of these
groups. Additional groups can be created for special purpose systems.

Actuators can be of various types:
  OOrocket:     liquid fuel rockets
  OOsrb:        solid fuel rockets
  OOjetengine:  jet engines
  OOmagtorquer: magneto torquers
  OOwing:       wings
  OOflap:       flaps

These are all inheriting the base actuator class. The rocket and srb class are
typically used for creating both thrusters and orbital engines, there is nothing
inherently different about those two type of actuators, only the size.

When the system time step is carried out, all the actuators attached to active
stages in the different groups will be told to update their states (they then
request for example joystick axis data), after this update, all actuators in the
entire spacecraft (even for desabled stages, but not detached ones) are told to
do their time step, this timestep is used in order to update force and torque
data for the spacecraft.
